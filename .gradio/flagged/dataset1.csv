9.9와 9.11 중 무엇이 더 큰가요?,"9.9는 9.11보다 더 큽니다.

이를 이해하기 위해 먼저 두 숫자를 비교하겠습니다:

- both numbers have the same whole number part, which is 9.
- In order to make a fair comparison, I'll align their decimal places by writing 9.9 as 9.90.

Now, let's compare each digit after the decimal point:

- Tenths place: Both numbers have 9.
- Hundredths place: 9 has 9 and 11 has 0.

Since 9 is greater than 0 in the hundredths place for 9.90 compared to 9.11, it follows that 9.9 is larger than 9.11.",2025-06-13 15:58:42.231027
